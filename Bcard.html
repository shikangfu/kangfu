            <p>Dear.</p>
            <p>Hi, welcome to Mickey's website.</p>
            <p>This is my introduction.</p>
            <p>I was a recent graduate from Henan in China. I was born in 2003. I live in a simple village. I had
                  graduated
                  from a community college in Zhengzhou, and have transfered to a bachelor's university by the
                  examination. I am a senior at the college of engineering, so my major is civil engineering.</p>
            <p>Recently, I am learning enlish spoken and listening on Duolingo. If you are learning english and find a
                  partner, I
                  will invite you to search "Mister.Mickey"on Duolingo and study together.
                  If you never use this application and don't want pay some money for super, you can join in my class on
                  Duolingo for school and you will have unlimited heart. My class code is <a
                        href="https://www.duolingo.com/classroom/crvbjk"> CRVBJK</a>.
                  Because a class only has fifty students, so you can send me email if there are some wrong. I will
                  immediately answer and help you when I see your mail.
            </p>
            <p>I have written some blogs and post it on another website this since Oct.25th 2024. You can click the<a
                        href="https://shikangfu.github.io/kangfu/blog.html"> link </a>to
                  read them. You will know more about me. </p>
            <p>Thank you for your watching. Have a good time.</p>
